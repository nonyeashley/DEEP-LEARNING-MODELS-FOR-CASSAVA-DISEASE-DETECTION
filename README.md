**Project Overview**
This project aims to detect cassava plant diseases using deep learning techniques. The models compared include:

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
ResNet50
InceptionV3
MobileNetV2
The dataset for this project is sourced from Kaggle, containing labeled images of cassava plants categorized into three classes:

Brown Streak
Healthy
Mosaic Disease
The analysis evaluates the performance of each model based on accuracy, loss, and validation metrics.
